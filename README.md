# Speech-Assistant
A very basic Speech Assistant program in python

The packages used are given in the requirement.txt file 

The pyaudio package sometimes might not install and window users might get errors. 
Apparently for windows there is no prebuilt wheel for python 3.7 or above 
Solution:
  Christoph Gohlke (University of California) hosts Windows wheels for most popular packages for nearly all modern Python versions, including latest PyAudio.
  You can find it here: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/. 
  Before downloading find your Python version by python --version
  And also check if you have got a 32bit python or 64bit
Installation:
  Go to the folder where it is downloaded for example cd C:\Users\foobar\Downloads
  Install using pip e.g pip install file
